# E-Commerce App

This is a sample e-commerce application built using Next.js.

## Features
- Customisable product catalog
- Shopping cart and checkout
- User authentication
- Search and filtering
- Order history and tracking
- Admin panel for managing products and orders

## Getting Started

1. First, run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

3. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

4. [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
